# Remove Shropshire Star/MNA paywalls

Over the last few years, quality of writing has declined but number of user-hostile changes have increased.

I realise that news organisations need to be paid, but Shropshire Star reporters have in the past offered to pay for professional photographs in "Exposure". Exposure doesn't pay the bills, Sue.


## How to use

You'll need a userscript manager in your browser:

Very quickly put together, if something breaks, I'll try to fix it. The code is also nothing to be proud of, but it works.
